    # Quoting from the blog (https://huggingface.co/blog/paligemma#detailed-inference-process):
    #   The input text is tokenized normally.
    #   A <bos> token is added at the beginning, and an additional newline token (\n) is appended.
    #   This newline token is an essential part of the input prompt the model was trained with, so adding it explicitly ensures it's always there.
    #   The tokenized text is also prefixed with a fixed number of <image> tokens.
    # NOTE: from the paper it looks like the `\n` should be tokenized separately, but in the HF implementation this is not done.
